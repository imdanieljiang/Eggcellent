# Eggcellent

A website for a restaurant that specializes in egg dishes. The website was created in JavaScript, React.js, and Tailwind CSS.

The website is currently deployed on GitHub pages here: https://imdanieljiang.github.io/Eggcellent/

The purpose of this project was to learn and practice Tailwind CSS, a CSS framework. Additionally, this is my first time making a deployment to GitHub pages.
